BookClub is built with React Native. Created to help solve the problem of finding the perfect book and organzing a bookclub event by keeping it all in one place. Backend utilizes Google Firebase Authentication, Firebase Cloud Database and Firebase Storage, API calls from GoogleReads.com, Google Books and NYTimes. 
This was a study for full stack mobile design to combine high-end UX/UI design with scalable backend logic to create a real world working app that is ready to launch.
